# Machine Learning Assignment 1
## Student Number: MRTNIK003
## Project Title: FashionMNIST Classification Using a Feedforward Neural Network

### Contents of This Archive
This archive contains all files used and produced for the completion of ML Assignment 1. The files are organized as follows:

- classifier.py: — Main Python script used to train and evaluate the neural network model.
- log.txt: — Output log from a full training run. Contains training loss per epoch and final test accuracy.
- Validation_Accuracy.png: — Graph of validation accuracy per epoch.
- Validation_Loss.png: — Graph of validation loss per epoch.
- README: — This file. Describes how to run and interpret the project.
- The only packages that are required are: Matplotlib, numpy, and torchvision
- .git: — Git repository for version control.
- report: - Contains the information of how the model was built

### How to Run the Code
Linux:
python3 classifier.py

# Before running the code, ensure that the fashionMNIST is in the same directory as the code. The code runs with the assumption that the FashionMNIST is in the same directory as the code.

### Output:
- log.txt containing the training loss and accuracy printed after each epoch
- Validation_Accuracy.png
- Validation_loss.png
- results.png
